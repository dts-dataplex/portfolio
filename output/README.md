## Human Review Process

1. **Agent generates draft** → Placed in `drafts/` directory
2. **Agent notifies human** → File path in `.agent-system/human-review/`
3. **Human reviews and approves** → Moved to `approved/` directory
4. **Agent tracks submission** → Application Tracker records details

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Archive submitted materials after 90 days
- Delete rejected drafts after 30 days
- Keep approved versions indefinitely
- Compress old reports quarterly

### Organization
- Create company subdirectories as needed
- Maintain separation between drafts and approved versions
- Link files to application tracking records
- Preserve version history for iterative improvements

## Backup Strategy

While these files are excluded from git, they should be backed up:

```bash
# Example backup to encrypted storage
tar -czf career-output-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz output/
gpg -c career-output-backup-*.tar.gz
```

Store encrypted backups in:
- Personal cloud storage (encrypted)
- External drive (encrypted)
- NAS (with encryption)

## Usage Examples

### Review Latest Drafts
```bash
ls -lt output/resumes/drafts/ | head
ls -lt output/cover_letters/drafts/ | head
```

### Find Materials for Specific Company
```bash
find output/ -name "*Acme*"
```

### Check Approval Status
```bash
ls output/resumes/approved/
ls output/cover_letters/approved/
```

### Review Analysis Reports
```bash
cat output/reports/job-analysis-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```
